# Releasing

In this document you'll find all the necessary steps to release a new version of `xcodeproj`:

1. Run `tapestry release version-number` (eg `tapestry release 7.1.0`) *(Install [tapestry](https://github.com/ackeecz/tapestry) if you don't have it installed already)*.
2. Create a new release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tuist/XcodeProj) including the information from the last entry in the `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Attach `XcodeProj.framework.zip` to the GitHub release.
